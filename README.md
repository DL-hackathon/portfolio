## Data Scraping
Implementation of the game [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon): scraping data from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), calculate "distance" between two randomly chosen actors and plot a graph of social distances.

## Applied Machine Learning

Regression task: predict level of income of a person.

## Deep Learning

Two basic tasks of DL are considered:
* Computer vision: classify food category of [FOOD-101 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) by applying Transfer learning technique to ResNet and ViT.
* Natural Language Processing: work with different versions of BERT model and use it to solve the [RuCoLa](https://rucola-benchmark.com/) task.
